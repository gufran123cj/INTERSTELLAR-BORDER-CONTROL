# INTRODUCTION

### Problem

Imagine a planet without a customs officer. Everyone would go in as they wanted and this would 
cause a lot of problems like murder, theft, incompatibility problems, cultural conflict etc. And 
imagine a customs officer without our software they would have to do tons of paperwork. Our 
software solves this problem and makes customs officers work easier.

### Goals

Our software has a user-friendly interface which customs officers can interact with ease. A customs 
officer can easily check the visitors identity and attributes with our program and judge accordingly. 
Our software makes it easy to keep both the visitors and the residents of the planet safe and sound.

### Stakeholders

Several different types of stakeholders can be noted when it comes to our software. The most 
obvious ones are rulers of planets, countries and galactic federations. They might like to use our 
software on their borders to keep their countries safer.

### Motivation

To make the Gotham Galaxy safer, better and more livable. We aimed to make a border control 
system interface that inspired from the video game “Papers Please”.
